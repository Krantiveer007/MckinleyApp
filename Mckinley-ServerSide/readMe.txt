Hi All, Welcome to Login Logout WorkFlow -> server side implementation, please refer to below steps for starting
the server on your local machine.

Note: Before following below steps make sure you have latest version of Node installed on your machine.

Steps to run node server : 
    1> Run Command 'npm install' from the current directory, this command will install the required 
       node_modules from node package manager.
    2> Once installation is finished, Run Command: 'npm start' from the current directory, this will start
       the node app server on your local machine(i.e., http://localhost:8082).
